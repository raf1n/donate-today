          Each year in Bangladesh about 26,000 square kilometres (10,000 sq mi)
          (around 18% of the country) is flooded, killing over 5,000 people and
          destroying more than seven million homes. During severe floods the
          affected area may exceed 75% of the country, as was seen in 1998. This
          volume is 95% of the total annual inflow.
