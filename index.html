          Each year in Bangladesh about 26,000 square kilometres (10,000 sq mi)
          (around 18% of the country) is flooded, killing over 5,000 people and
          destroying more than seven million homes. During severe floods the
          affected area may exceed 75% of the country, as was seen in 1998. This
          volume is 95% of the total annual inflow.

          <h3>Food for a family</h3>
          <p>
            Food is one of the basic necessities of humans, and it stands first
            among all basic needs - food, shelter, and clothing. It is important
            as it nourishes the human body- sustaining the very existences of
            humans. Over the years, food has taken a position beyond this. Food
            is now a social instrument.

          <h3>Shelter for a family</h3>
          <p>
            What are the basic needs for shelter? Shelter is a basic human need
            crucial for survival in cases of natural hazards or conflict. It
            provides security, personal safety and protection from the weather,
            and prevents ill health and disease. Adequate housing provides
            people with dignity and the opportunity to lead a normal life.

          <h3>Education for a child</h3>
          <p>
            Education is a basic human right and is necessary for sustainable
            social and economic development. The education of girls is one of
            the most important determinants of development. Investment in basic
            education is indis- pensable for human development and pro-poor
            growth.
